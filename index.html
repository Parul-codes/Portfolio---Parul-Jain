                    <a id="link" href="https://github.com/Parul-codes/MindSpace-Parul-Jain"><li><b>MindSpace – Personal Mood Keeper (Java Console App) -</b> Developed a modular Java application 
    combining digital detox tools, journaling, and mood-based music recommendations into one wellness 
    platform. Implemented using OOP principles with separate modules. The app features a focus timer 
    with streak tracking and motivational quotes, a file-based diary entry system, and a mood-driven 
    music recommender with customizable tracks and persistence. This project reflects both my technical 
    problem-solving skills and interest in creating tools that promote productivity and well-being.</li></a>
                    <a id="link" href="https://github.com/Parul-codes/pitchpal-parul-jain"><li><b>PitchPal – Brand Outreach Tracker -</b> Built an AI-supported Streamlit-based web application to 
    simplify influencer - brand outreach management. The core idea, workflow, and modifications were 
    conceptualized and implemented by me, while I also leveraged AI for the code base foundation, 
    adapting and extending it into a functional tool. This project reflects my ability to combine AI powered development with personal problem-solving and design improvements.</li></a>
                    <a id="link" href="https://github.com/Parul-codes/Kind-Connect---Parul-Jain"><li><b>KindConnect – Hackathon Project -</b> KindConnect is a platform designed to bridge the gap between 
    NGOs and donors. It features an interactive map system to help donors locate nearby NGOs and 
    donation points easily, along with an AI-driven recommendation system that suggests relevant causes 
    based on user interests. My role involved working on the frontend, integrating APIs, and refining the 
    concept to make the solution more practical and impactful.</li></a>
